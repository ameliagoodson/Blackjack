# Blackjack

## Overview
Blackjack is a classic card game where the player competes against the dealer - in this case, the computer. The winner is determined by the first player to reach a score of 21 without going over 21. This is a simplified version of Blackjack where the rules are as follows:
* Cards 2 - 10 are scored according to their card number
* An Ace, which can usually count as 1 or 11, will be counted as a 1 if an 11 would push the user over 21
* Kings, Queens and Jacks are counted as 10
* The computer must hit (take another card) if their score is less than 17
* Only the computer's first card is visible to the player
